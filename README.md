**Brief Description:**

We release a data set to accompany the **Monitoring the Morphology of
M87\* in 2009â€“2017 with the Event Horizon Telescope** paper (Wielgus
et al. 2020). It contains timestamp, telescope codes, *u-v*
coordinates, debiased visibility amplitude, and estimated RMS
uncertainty of M87\* data from the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT)'s
2011, 2012, and 2013 observation campaign. The data set is made public
simultaneously with Wielgus et al. (2020).

The 2009 data set was previously used in Doeleman et al. (2012) and
can be found here:
http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/other/Sci/338.355
. The 2012 visibility amplitude data set was previously used in
Akiyama et al. (2015), but has been now updated (see Wielgus et
al. for details) and is republished. The 2012 closure phase data set
did not change and can be found here:
http://vizier.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/VizieR?-source=J/ApJ/807/150 . The
2011 and 2013 data were never published before. Details of the data
processing are documented in section 2 of Wielgus et al. (2020). The
paper also uses EHT's 2017 data, which was described in details in
EHTC et al. (2019).

All data are stored as self-described text files, which are located in
the `"dat/"` subdirectory. The tgz file is a gzipped tarball that
contains the whole repository. It is included in this repository for
convenience.
